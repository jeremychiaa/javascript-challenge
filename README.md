# javascript-challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3, this website allows you to easily and quickly look up information about all the reported UFO sightings in the US and in Canada.

There are two sites available that I have put together:

- [Date Search](https://jeremychiaa.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-1/index.html)
  - This site allows you to do a quick search for UFO sightings and filter those search results by a specific date a UFO sighting was reported.
  - The code for this site is available in the [UFO-level-1](./UFO-level-1) folder of this repository.
  - This site is deployed to GitHub pages.
- [Multiple Search Categories](https://jeremychiaa.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-2/index.html)
  - This site includes all the functionality of the first site, but in addition, this site allows you to set multiple filters and do a more advanced search on specific criteria, including date, city, state, country, and shape.
  - The code for this site is available in the [UFO-level-2](./UFO-level-2) folder of this repository.
  - This site is deployed to GitHub pages.
